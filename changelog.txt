Changes in V0.14 (V2): 

1) extra power wire runs up teensy side of board - FIXED, wire removed
2) teensy power pin to CC3 isn't on side row - FIXED changed from Vusb to Vin (connected on teensy)
3) 10uF caps on BOM are 1206, board is 0603? - FIXED. board is now 1206.
4) cc3 top and bottom through-holes are too small!!! - FIXED. increased from 0.75mm to 1.2mm
5) U11/14 on board is U14/15 on BOM - FIXED. BOM was out of date.
6) absolutely need 1uF bypass cap on 2.5v reg. FIXED.
7) C4 is extraneous? - FIXED. moved to address issue 7.
8) orientation of ICs was not marked. now marked on silkscreen
9) added voltage output on each channel.
9b). added mux to monitor either final voltage output or current output from Howland.
10) moved both ADC and DAC to single SPI line (no reason for extra wires).
11) I/O breakout changed to BNCs and push-terminals instead of screw terminals and SMA. 
12) added enclosure and panels pcbs for mounting in a nice box. 
13) pushbuttons removed. 


Changes in V0.16 (V3):
0) isolated each channel separately (no shared ground)
1) removed +-12V LDO regulators (now directly using +-15V)
2) removed MCP4922 DAC (0-5V,12bit), replaced with AD5752 (+-10V, 16bit)
3) added breakout for teensy pins in enclosure panel
4) added reset button for teensy on enclosure panel (program pin isnt broken out - need airwire!)
5) added indicator LEDs
6) added 1Mohm resistors and 2.2nF caps to couple GND_0 and GND_1 with GND (avoid huge floating potentials
and make sure animal can slowly discharge)
7) changed name to stimjim

Changes in V0.17:
1) moved MISO lines out of isolators onto different teensy pins so that they don't interfere.
2) added 10k pulldown resistors to MISO lines (in isolated sections) - not strictly necessary but probably a good idea.

Changes in V0.18:
1) Board switched from 2-layer to 4-layer (added ground and power planes).
2) Added many test points throughout board.
3) Replaced ISO7341 with ISO7741 to match speed and delay of ISO7760, so SPI can run faster.
4) Replaced AD8276 with AMP03 for higher bandwidth current stimulation.
