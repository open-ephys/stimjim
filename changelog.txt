Changes in V0.13: 

1) switch is surface mount, not through hole (pcb is throughhole) - FIXED, pcb is now SMD
2) extra power wire runs up teensy side of board - FIXED, wire removed
3) teensy power pin to CC3 isn't on side row - FIXED changed from Vusb to Vin (connected on teensy)
4) 10uF caps on BOM are 1206, board is 0603? - FIXED. board is now 1206.
5) cc3 top and bottom through-holes are too small!!! - FIXED. increased from 0.75mm to 1.2mm
6) U11/14 on board is U14/15 on BOM - FIXED. BOM was out of date.
7) absolutely need 1uF bypass cap on 2.5v reg. FIXED.
8) C4 is extraneous? - FIXED. moved to address issue 7.

To do:
9) orientation of ICs is not marked!
10) board should have voltage out option on each channel!
11) confirm that two separate SPIs both work  -
